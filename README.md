Neuroshell is an AI embedded terminal and focused on making the terminal more ambient, fun and easy.

## Windowless GUI

The GUI is built with **Electron**, **React**, and **xterm.js**. It opens a fullscreen, borderless window and runs your shell through `node-pty`. The terminal behaves like a standard one and is ready for future animated backgrounds.

### Running the GUI

```bash
cd gui/electron
npm install
npm start
```
